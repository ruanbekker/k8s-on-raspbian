## Kubernetes on Raspbian

This repository holds the original tutorial for "Kubernetes on Raspbian" / Raspberry Pi by Alex Ellis

This guide is part of a larger blog post: [Build your own bare-metal ARM cluster](https://blog.alexellis.io/build-your-own-bare-metal-arm-cluster/).

### Start the guide

Pick between `k3s` or `kubeadm`.

#### 1) Pick `k3s` (recommended)

My current recommendation is to use [k3s](https://k3s.io) from Rancher Labs. It is normal Kubernetes and passes the conformance tests written by the CNCF. I'm yet to be convinced of why someone wouldn't use this for a hobbyist build and I've been pleasantly surprised by it.

k3s is:

* faster, and uses fewer resources
* well-maintained and ARMHF / ARM64 just works
* still normal, upstream, compliant Kubernetes
* doesn't appear to run into some of the complicated issues we've seen with `kubeadm`

Start now: [Will it cluster? k3s on your Raspberry Pi](https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/)

#### 2) Or pick `kubeadm`  (advanced users)

My current thinking is that only advanced users should attempt to install Kubernetes with `kubeadm`. Historically, it's had some unfortunate issues around timeouts and being slow.

* Start the guide: [Kubernetes on (vanilla) Raspbian Lite](./GUIDE.md)
